              <p>I love to read books. Do you? The idea of this app is to solve common readers' problems: what to read next and how to free your home from already read books that you don't want to keep. One neat aspect of participating in a book exchange is the benefit to the environment and reduce carbon footprint.</p>

              <h3>Build trust in Fintech</h3>
              <p>Fintech is diverse and challenging. Financial companies come up with more and more interesting services and they, however, have something in common. The success of financial services is based on the clients' trust. What about building this trust itself? I've tried to figure out the case of start-ups, that offer a scoring assessment.</p>

              <h3>Beat queue app - the UX-case study</h3>
              <p>Once again, standing in line for coffee at my favorite coffee shop and nervously looking at my watch, I was fantasizing. About how I go out of the house, order coffee and pick it up on the way to work. About how I don't waste time standing in line and having the desired drink in a rush. And I walk with my fragrant cup, enjoying the new day.</p>

            <h3>Hello, I'm Hanna</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was a child I liked creating all kinds of things. However, fate has decided otherwise and I have taught economics and mathematics. So, I got a Master's in Economic Cybernetic. Thanks to it I’m familiar with technology and numbers.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, life throws unexpected surprises and sharp turns.
                Leaving the comfort zone was an amazing opportunity to realize my personal pursuit.</p>
            <p>I took the UI/UX design course and did the first step in a new sphere and started crafting user interfaces. I worked for small startups and crafted products across the most popular platforms.</p>
            <p>And now I begin a new chapter in my life. I start coding.</p>
            <p>Every new task for me is an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in a new field of knowledge and try to make human's everyday being even a little bit better.</p>
